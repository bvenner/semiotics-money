# Why Study Semiotics and Values Simultaneously {#unit1:lecture1}

The subject of this course is value, 

to look at the concept of economic, moral and logical value from the viewpoint of semiotics.  It will also attempt to be an self-contained introduction to these areas, that is, it will not assume prior acquaintance with either subject.  Since there is clearly an increase in complexity by considering these different aspects of value, I and others believe that there is a potential increase in comprehension by combining these aspects, and thus a potential compression of the time necessary to obtain aquaintance than if the subjects were approached independently.

## Value or values {#unit1:lecture1:}

## Semiotic or semiotics
Semiotics, or the doctrine of signs, is intentionally very broad.  It's fundamental concept is the sign, and it finds signs everywhere.  The Peircian school of semiotics, in particular, finds signs in both the natural and cultural worlds, and posits that signs serve to cross between these two areas.  If semiotics has a home discipline, it is in philosophy.  Peirce understood philosophy as the theory of ordinary experience, which served as a foundational study to the more specialized sciences, such as economics.  Thus, one way to understand this course would be as thus study of the philosophy of economics, albeit from a somewhat idiosyncratic philosophical perspective.

The critic would say that this is a step in the wrong direction.  The usual "origin story" of the development of economics begins with Adam Smith, who was famously a professor of moral philosophy.  In this story, economics breaks the yoke of Aristotelian philosophy and proceeds down an path of development as an independent science.  Economics self-consciously begins to imitate the natural sciences, particularly during its neoclassical phase, and economic laws begin being stated within a mathematical framework borrowed from 19th century classical physics [see @mirowski:1991:when].  In particular, the use of mathematics becomes mandatory to obtain an advanced degree in economics.

A corollary to this story is that the separation of economics from philosophy, once achieved, means that the development of philosophy and economics has remained separate.  But the story of 20th century physics involved philosophy, which played a major role in at least framing the issues, if not in its develpment.  I believe that the story of 21st century economics will follow a similar path.  The chasm between economic theory and the planetery emergency of climate change will force

Semiotics does not belong to the natural or social sciences.  Therefore, the advantage of studying economic value from such a perspective is that it may allow

But in order to not beg the question of the nature of economic value, it is necessary to consider the concept of value in it's broadest sense before focusing attention on how the concept has been used in economics.

Value is a fundamental concept, more at the level of a tone than a thing.  Given the wide variety of uses of the concept, is there a
