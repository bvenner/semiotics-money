title: On Semiotics and Values

The notion of prices as a language and system of communication is well established.  However, this language is taken to be extremely restricted within neoclassical economics.  The nature of this system is taken to be similar to a closed thermodynamic system with a uniquely determined value.  It is mechanical at it's core.

So what does a living (i.e. non-mechanical) theory of economics look like?  My plan for this investigation is to build upon the theories of value developed by Marx and Peirce.  Strydom believes in the close relationship of these two thinkers.  I would like to reframe their thought using modal homotopy type theory, as developed in [Categorical Semiotics](https://github.com/bvenner/categorical-semiotics).  A hint that this would be possible is provided by Lee Smolin's sole foray into economics, where he proposed gauge theory as an important direction for general equilibrium theory.  So could Schneider's development of gauge theory within modal homotopy type theory be useful here?

Reading about Sraffa reminds me of Rosen's relational biology.  In particular, the notion of a self-reproducing economy sounds like Rosen's MR sytem.

A related branch to modal homotopy type theory that might be useful is Bell's paper *From Absolute to Local Mathematics* [@bell:1986:absolute].  Can this paper be applied to metrology?  My intuition is that the metrology of values looks more like the local metrology applicable in chemistry than the absolute metrology used in physics (I'd love to find this paper again!).  Ian Wright discusses the inspiration that the nascent physical metrology had on David Ricardo in his development of the labor theory of value [@wright:2017:marx].    Marx's distinction between use-value and exchange-value, and that exchange value is based on the labor theory of value.  In this way, the absolute metrology of the labor theory of value, as derived from Ricardo, is a basis of the capitalist system but not necessarily the most desirable system.  So could a socialist system be developed on a local metrology of use-values? 

Is there a duality between production and distribution in economics?  Neoclassical economics places distribution prior to production, while classical economics placed production ahead of distribution.  Is this a nature/nurture distinction?  It seems like it would be better to think of these as a relation with corresponding logical and physical transformations (a la Bell), the behavioral systems theory approach with relations and constraints, or Ellerman's analysis of adjoint functors as a profunctor (aka a generized relation).  A potentially interesting insight here is Martin's analogy in the *classical circular economy* of Sraffa's system as a replacement for the neoclassical production function and Sen's capability approach as a replacement for the neoclassical distribution system.  The relationship between this and Ian Wright's work solving Marx's transformation problem needs attention.  

Mirowski's comparison of neoclassical economics and analytical philosophy, and the potential relationship of intuitionistic economics and pragmatic philosophy [mirowski:1992:mechanism].  Veblen as the first economist to analyze monopoly capitalism (as cited by Foster [@foster:2016:endless], and Veblen's somewhat loose connection to the pragmatist tradition.  

Read *The End of Value-Free Economics* [@putnam:2012:end], as this explores the link between pragmatism and the capability approach, with Putnam representing pragmatism and Walsh representing the capability approach.

Martins:  
> Nussbaum focuses essentially on Marx, and, more specifically, on the Aristotelian underpinnings of Marx's conception. [@martins:2018:classical].
Unfortunately, he does not give an explicit textual link here.  But this would be interesting to explore.
