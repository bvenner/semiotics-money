title: On Semiotic of Values

The notion of prices as a language and system of communication is well established.  However, this language is taken to be extremely restricted within neoclassical economics.  The nature of this system is taken to be similar to a closed thermodynamic system with a uniquely determined value.  It is mechanical at it's core.

So what does a living (i.e. non-mechanical) theory of economics look like?  My plan for this investigation is to build upon the theories of value developed by Marx and Peirce.  Strydom believes in the close relationship of these two thinkers.  I would like to reframe their thought using modal homotopy type theory, as developed in [Categorical Semiotics](https://github.com/bvenner/categorical-semiotics).  A hint that this would be possible is provided by Lee Smolin's sole foray into economics, where he proposed gauge theory as an important direction for general equilibrium theory.  So could Schneider's development of gauge theory within modal homotopy type theory be useful here?

Reading about Sraffa reminds me of Rosen's relational biology.  In particular, the notion of a self-reproducing economy sounds like Rosen's MR sytem.

A related branch to modal homotopy type theory that might be useful is Bell's paper *From Absolute to Local Mathematics* [@bell:1986:absolute].  Can this paper be applied to metrology?  My intuition is that the metrology of values looks more like the local metrology applicable in chemistry than the absolute metrology used in physics (I'd love to find this paper again!).  Ian Wright discusses the inspiration that the nascent physical metrology had on David Ricardo in his development of the labor theory of value [@wright:2017:marx].    Marx distinguishes between use-value and exchange-value, and that exchange value is based on the labor theory of value.  Marx argued that the "absolute" metrology of the labor theory of value, as derived from Ricardo, was the basis of the capitalist system.  My understanding is that Marx did not believe that this was the most desirable system, and that the free association of producers would somehow produce use-values without the mediation of exchange-values.  

So could a socialist system be developed on a local metrology of use-values? This was the central issue in the [socialist calculation debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_calculation_debate).  The Wikipedia article mentions distributed economic planning as the successor to this debate.  It also dicusses the use of information technology to provide much richer information about various flows than could be provided by prices.  The subheadings in the Wikipedia page on "Contemporary Contributions" are "networked digital feedback", "cybernetic coordination", "participatory economics", "decentralized pricing without markets", "market socialism", and "mechanism design."  I've heard of very few of the authors mentioned in this page.  There is also an unstated link with value flows, open-value accounting, and other efforts coming out of the P2P Foundation.   

Is there a duality between production and distribution in economics?  Neoclassical economics places distribution prior to production, while classical economics placed production ahead of distribution.  Is this a nature/nurture distinction?  It seems like it would be better to think of these as a relation with corresponding logical and physical transformations (a la Bell), the behavioral systems theory approach with relations and constraints, or Ellerman's analysis of adjoint functors as a profunctor (aka a generized relation).  A potentially interesting insight here is Martin's analogy in the *classical circular economy* of Sraffa's system as a replacement for the neoclassical production function and Sen's capability approach as a replacement for the neoclassical distribution system.  The relationship between this and Ian Wright's work solving Marx's transformation problem needs attention.  

Mirowski's comparison of neoclassical economics and analytical philosophy, and the potential relationship of intuitionistic economics and pragmatic philosophy [mirowski:1992:mechanism].  Veblen as the first economist to analyze monopoly capitalism (as cited by Foster [@foster:2016:endless], and Veblen's somewhat loose connection to the pragmatist tradition.  

Read *The End of Value-Free Economics* [@putnam:2012:end], as this explores the link between pragmatism and the capability approach, with Putnam representing pragmatism and Walsh representing the capability approach.

Martins:  
> Nussbaum focuses essentially on Marx, and, more specifically, on the Aristotelian underpinnings of Marx's conception. [@martins:2018:classical].
Unfortunately, Martins does not give an explicit textual link here.  But this would be interesting to explore.  Although Nussbuam's endorsement of Hickenlooper on The Ezra Klein Show makes me a lot less interested in studying the capabilities approach.
