title: On Semiotics and Value

The notion of prices as a language and system of communication is well established.  However, this language is taken to be extremely restricted within neoclassical economics.  The nature of this system is taken to be similar to a closed thermodynamic system with a uniquely determined value.  It is mechanical at it's core.

So what does a living (i.e. non-mechanical) theory of economics look like?  My plan for this investigation is to build upon the theories of value developed by Marx and Peirce.  Strydom believes in the close relationship of these two thinkers.  I would like to reframe their thought using modal homotopy type theory, as developed in [Categorical Semiotics](https://github.com/bvenner/categorical-semiotics).  A hint that this would be possible is provided by Lee Smolin's sole foray into economics, where he proposed gauge theory as an important direction for general equilibrium theory.  So could Schneider's development of gauge theory within modal homotopy type theory be useful here?

Reading about Sraffa reminds me of Rosen's relational biology.  In particular, the notion of a self-reproducing economy sounds like Rosen's MR sytem.
